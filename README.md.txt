Project Description

Food is essential for human life and has been the concern of many healthcare conventions. Nowadays new dietary
assessment and nutrition analysis tools enable more opportunities to help people understand their daily eating 
habits, exploring nutrition patterns and maintain a healthy diet. Nutritional analysis is the process of
determining the nutritional content of food. It is a vital part of analytical chemistry that provides information 
about the chemical composition, processing, quality control and contamination of food.

 The main aim of the project is to building a model which is used for classifying the fruit depends on the different
characteristics like colour, shape, texture etc. Here the user can capture the images of different fruits and then the 
image will be sent the trained model. The model analyses the image and detect the nutrition based on the fruits like
(Sugar, Fibre, Protein, Calories, etc.).

Project Flow and Progress

The users intercts with the UI (User Interface) and give the image as input. Then the input image is then pass to our 
flask application,And finally with the help of the model which we build we will classify the result and showcase it on 
the UI.

To accomplish this, we have to complete all the activities and tasks listed below

Data Collection:
 1) Collect the dataset or Create the dataset

Image Preprocessing:
  1) Import the ImageDataGenerator library
  2) Configure ImageDataGenerator class
  3) Applying ImageDataGenerator functionality to trainset and testset

Model Building
  1) Importing The Model Building Libraries
  2) Initializing The Model
  3) Adding CNN Layers
  4) Adding Dense Layers
  5) Configure The Learning Process
  6) Train The Model
  7) Save The Model
  8) Test The Model
  
Train The Model On IBM
  1) Register For IBM Cloud
  2) Train Model On IBM 
     (used to integrate flask application)

Application Building:
  1) Create HTML Pages
  2) Build Python Code
  3) Run The Application
